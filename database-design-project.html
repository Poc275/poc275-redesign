                <p>The aim of this project was to design a multi-user database system for an online shoe store.</p>

                <p>The first step was to identify the entities, relationships and attributes by analysing the project brief. The entities are the things 
                    of significance about which information needs to be known, such as shoes, customers and orders. Relationships explain how the entities
                     are related (one to one, one to many), and the attributes contain specific information about the entities, such as shoe types, gender and 
                     payment method. The result of this is a conceptual entity relationship diagram, which is a first attempt at modelling the database.</p>

                <p>The next step is to break down any many to many relationships as these cannot be represented by a relational database. The conceptual diagram 
                    had a many to many relationship between &lsquo;order&rsquo; and &lsquo;stock&rsquo; i.e. each stock item may be bought via one or many order/s, 
                    and each order must be issued for one or many item/s of stock. A weak entity called &lsquo;order detail&rsquo; was created to break this 
                    relationship down. Now each order must contain one or many order detail/s, and each order detail must relate to only one order (a one to many 
                    relationship). Each stock item may be bought via one or many order detail/s, and each order detail must order only one stock item (also a 
                    one to many relationship). This is depicted in the logical entity relationship diagram.</p>

                        the entity i.e. the attribute that uniquely identifies each record. The suffix (fk) refers to a foreign key. This is 
                        required to implement the relationships between the entities.

                <p>The normalisation process was next. This is required to minimise data redundancy which causes integrity problems. Update and delete 
                    transactions may not be consistently applied to all copies of the data causing inconsistencies. Normalisation was carried out up to 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form" target="_blank">Third Normal Form (3NF)</a>. 
                    This helped identify three more entities that were previously missed. A data dictionary was then produced to identify all of the data types 
                    for the attributes. The model was now in a suitable state for it to be created in an actual <abbr title="Database Management System">DBMS</abbr>. 
                    MySQL (later migrated to SQL Server) was chosen for this as it is a widely used and readily available DBMS. The physical entity relationship 
                    model depicts the MySQL database.</p>

                <p>A front end was then created using PHP to test the database. To accomplish this a navigation map was produced by applying use case 
                    scenarios to the system to identify all of the pages that are required, which tables and attributes are required, whether the page is 
                    static or dynamic, public or private, and if the page requires read or write permissions on the database. The idea is that a front 
                    end developer can pick this up and have an immediate overview of how to put the site together. It is also often shown to business 
                    managers for approval.</p>
