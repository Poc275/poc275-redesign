Prometheus lived with the humans but became concerned as to their lack of zest, he decided they needed fire, but not just normal fire, divine fire, which would enflame their sense of imagination and daring. He stole divine fire from Hephaestus's forge on Mount Olympus and taught mankind how to make use of it.

This was foiled when his wife discovered the plan, took revenge by drowning their two children, and fled back to her father. He angered the gods so much that Zeus personally sent Thanatos to take him to the underworld. However, proud of his cunning, he tricked Thanatos into handcuffing himself by mocking his shackles and saying that they wouldn't work. He then kept Thanatos prisoner in his wardrobe. Knowing that without death, the gods would be on his tail sooner or later, he made a pact with his new wife to not make offerings to the gods when he did eventually die so that he couldn't cross the River Styx. When Thanatos was finally rescued he came for him again and took him to the underworld. When he couldn't cross the Styx he swam across, looking the worse for wear on the other side he spoke with Persephone, Queen of the underworld, and told her that his appearance was due to his wife's neglect in not making offerings to the gods to enable his passage. A shocked Persephone wanted to punish his wife, but Sisyphus tricked her into sending him back to life to take revenge on her in person. They would go on to live happily ever after. When his wife died and Persephone's decree finally expired, Thanatos came for him a third time, but this time Hermes offered him a deal, in cheating death twice you have earned a chance at immortality. All you have to do is push this boulder up the slope and out of the opening at the top to attain immortality, or, you can go to Elysium and live a happy afterlife.

He could not move away as above him hovered a great stone that threatened to crush him if he did (this stone material would later be named tanatlum).

This pleased Athena, to whom snakes were sacred, and the snake whispered into Asclepius's ear the many secrets of healing and medicine. To this day, many ambulances and clinics can be seen with an emblem bearing a wooden staff (staff of Ascelpius) entwined with a serpent. Athena also presented a jar of Gorgon's blood as a reward. This famed liquid that keeps the gods immortal, is deadly to humans, but can bring the dead back to life. Later in life, unable to resist temptation, Asclepius started to use the blood on his patients. This angered Hades who complained that there were no more dead being delivered to him. Zeus agreed and struck Asclepius dead with a bolt of thunder. This angered Apollo, his father, so much that he struck the cyclopes Brontes, Steropes, and Arges dead (it was the cyclopes that manufactured Zeus's thunderbolts). Such rebelliousness was punished by Zeus and Apollo was commanded to serve the Thessalian King Admetus in a lowly position for one whole year.","home_pos":0,"age":"Bronze","nearest_olympian":8,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":243,"x":800.235867924219,"y":1202.1929998227795,"vy":-0.0444121156199189,"vx":0.009562204898810064},{"id":255,"name":"Epione","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"Soothing pain","gender":"Female","group":"Olympians","notes":"Her name means 'soothing', or 'relief from pain'.
