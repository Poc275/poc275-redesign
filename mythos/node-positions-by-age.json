He was rewarded for his bravery in the quest for the Golden Fleece with a wife, Eurydice. One day she was pursued by Aristaeus and she fell into a ditch trying to escape and was bitten by an adder and died. The grief caused Orpheus to stop playing his beautiful music, even the Gods wept. Finally his father Apollo told him to retrieve Eurydice from the underworld with a lyre strung with hairs from his own head. His mellifluous playing won over the hound of hell, Cerberus, and Charon, the ferryman of the dead, which enabled him to enter the palace of Hades itself. Queen of the underworld, Persephone, convinced her husband to let Orpheus play one song and if it moves them they shall release Eurydice. He played the most amazing song that transformed the underworld into a place of light and love. Hades agreed to let Eurydice go but on one condition, that she must follow ten paces behind and if he turns around to look at her, she will be kept in the underworld. He kept the correct pace right until the edge of the underworld, but unbeknownst to him, his last few steps had accelerated into a run, Eurydice, too far behind was still not over the threshold of the underworld when Orpheus looked back in triumph and she was pulled back into the darkness. Orpheus lived out the rest of his life shunning any advances from women eventually sparking the ire of the Ciconians, followers of Dionysus who found his music an affront to their dark dances. They tore him apart in a Bacchic frenzy. His head ended up on the island of Lesbos where it was taken to a cave where people would come from all around to seek guidance and to hear his music once more. Apollo, jealous that the shrine was becoming more popular than his own Delphic oracle, finally silenced him. Finally at peace, his spirit descended to the underworld where he could be with Eurydice at last.","home":"Thrace","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":8,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":73,"x":810.4423067263716,"y":1165.1882106680082,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":810.4423067263716,"fy":1165.1882106680082},{"id":76,"name":"Clio","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"God of History","gender":"Female","group":"The Muses","notes":"The Muses were the gods of music, song and dance and the source of inspiration to poets.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":670.5277563360548,"y":1148.414217515154,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":670.5277563360548,"fy":1148.414217515154},{"id":292,"name":"Marsyas","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Satyrs","notes":"A satyr, a follower of Dionysus he found Athena's aulos, a woodwind instrument that she had discarded from Olympus because she couldn't get a good enough sound from it.

He was rescued and taken to Corinth where he was raised by the King and Queen, Polybus and Merope. They named him Oedipus which means 'swollen foot' after the scars on his once shackled ankles. During his life he heard rumours that he was adopted so he consulted with the Delphic oracle. Instead of being told who his real parents were, in typical oracular cryptic fashion he was told, \"Oedipus will kill his father and mate with his mother\". He decided to leave Corinth to avoid the possibility of the prophecy coming true. Whilst on the road he got into a fight with a man in a chariot who had hurled abuse at him to get out of the way, Oedipus killed him and his entourage during the ensuing fight. He ended up making his way toward Thebes, he answered one of the Sphinx's riddles on the way to reopen the road and lift the curse. He was welcomed into the city as a hero and welcomed by Queen Jocasta, unbeknownst to Oedipus, this was his real mother. She told him that her husband had been killed on the road by a gang of robbers, this was the very same fight that Oedipus had gotten into, part of the prophecy had come true. In time he fell in love with Jocasta. He became King and they married and had four children, thus completing the prophecy. Later in his reign he again sought the advice of the Delphic oracle about a vicious plague that had swept through the kingdom. The Pythia answered, \"Thebes will be relieved when the murderer of King Laius is named and found.\" Oedipus sent for Laius' servant, Antimedes, who was the sole survivor of the fight that fateful day. As soon as Antimedes set eyes on Oedipus the whole horrendous truth came out. Oedipus discovered his true parents, his being abandoned by his mother and now wife, Jocasta, and the fact that the horrible prophecies had all come true. Jocasta ran away and hanged herself in the bedroom. Oedipus found her and thrust her gold brooch dress pins into his eyes in anguish.","home":"Thebes","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":6,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":289,"x":907.3276994167979,"y":1672.866277944986,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":907.3276994167979,"fy":1672.866277944986},{"id":301,"name":"Leda","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Female","group":"Thestiades","notes":"Zeus transformed into a swan to couple with her.","home":"Sparta","age":"Bronze","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":290,"x":713.8618293005549,"y":1190.1406101601615,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":713.8618293005549,"fy":1190.1406101601615},{"id":302,"name":"Tyndareus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"Heracles ousted his brother Hippocoön and put Tyndareus, the rightful ruler of Sparta, on the throne, which would have devestating consequences.

His wish was granted but he quickly realised this was indeed, a curse. Even his wife and daughter were transformed, he couldn't touch anything. Pleading with Dionysus, who told him he was lucky that Silenus was so fond of him, made it so that anything he washed in the nearby river would be transformed back again. A relieved Midas quickly restored his wife and daughter back to human form. He then devoted his life to a more bucolic existence becoming a follower of Pan, the god of nature.

From then on he wore a turban to keep his ears a secret, only his barber knew the truth. His barber, unable to keep it a secret any longer, buried the words, \"Midas has the ears of an ass\" in the ground. This would grow into a flower which released the words into the wild.

He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":548.216973404506,"y":1420.315587901692,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":548.216973404506,"fy":1420.315587901692},{"id":531,"name":"Bisaltes","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"Founder hero of the Bisaltae peoples of Thrace.","home":"Thrace","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":0,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":520,"x":526.2286122356036,"y":777.3114680481908,"vy":-0.015578787992622738,"vx":-0.017046998514327123},{"id":532,"name":"Theophane","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Female","group":"Humans","notes":"She caught the eye of Poseidon who took her to the island of Crinissa where he turned himself into a ram and Theophane into a ewe.

He wanted to enter Athens a hero to finally meet his father, so he set out along the dangerous coastal route from Troezen. During his travels he cleared the route of all evil, slaying monsters and murderes alike to enter Athens held aloft by an adoring public grateful to have the road made safe once more. Aegeus' wife, Jason's widow, Medea, was adamant that her own son, Medus, and not Theseus would be the heir to throne of Athens so she persuaded Aegeus, who didn't know it was his long lost son at this point, to order him to kill the Marathonian Bull. Theseus accomplished this heroic feat, inventing ancient bull fighting in the process. Medea then contrived to have him poisoned. Aegeus agreed, believing Theseus' fame was a threat to his rule. Just as Theseus was about to drink the poison, Aegeus noticed his sword. It was the exact same sword that he'd buried back in Troezen for his son to find one day. He managed to stop him drinking the poison just in time and father and son were united. Medea fled Athens never to return. Theseus then went to Crete to lift the tributes that Athens had to pay. This was due to Aegeus sending Minos' (King of Crete) son Androgeus to kill the Marathonian Bull and getting killed. Minos threatened to raze Athens to the ground unless a tribute of seven maidens and seven youths were sent from Athens every year to feed the minotaur Asterion. Theseus sent himself as one of the sacrifical lambs where he fell in love with Minos' daughter, Ariadne. She gave him a ball of cotton which he used to find his way through the labyrinth to kill Asterion. He fled Crete with Ariadne to the island of Naxos. It was here that Theseus had a dream in which Dionysus warned him to leave Ariadne on the island as she was betrothed to him. He took the tough decision to leave her to save the Athenians he'd managed to save from being sacrificed to Asterion. He later took Antiope, an Amazon warrior as his queen kickstarting the Attic War, or Amazonomachy. They managed to defeat the Amazons but Antiope was killed in the process. He then had a sort of mid-life crisis, getting into all sorts of scrapes with his best friend Pirithous. They had the terrible idea one day of trying to kidnap Persephone, Queen of the underworld to be Pirithous' wife. Hades had them cast into stone chairs, their buttocks stuck to the seats. Heracles managed to free them during his twelfth labour to retrieve Cerberus. He married Phaedra, the younger sister of Ariadne. When visiting his son Hippolytus, Phaedra, Hippolytus' step-mother, was struck by a curse sent from Aphrodite in revenge for Hippolytus' neglect in all matters of love. Phaedra declared her love to Hippolytus but it wasn't reciprocated. Phaedra cried rape to Theseus who prayed to his father Poseidon for justice. Hippolytus was trampled to death in a chariot \"accident\". Upon hearing this Phaedra killed herself. Theseus was exiled from Athens for this unwitting role in the deaths of his son and wife. The end of his life was marked by shame and bitterness. He ended up as the guest of King Lycomedes of Skyros where one day he fell to his death over a cliff, pushed by Lycomedes but the reason is lost to us. His legacy wasn't tarnished however, Theseus goes down as one of the great heroes of Greek myth, and the greatest in all of Athens. His statue stands proudly in the centre of Athens today in Syntagma Square.","home":"Athens","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":0,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":634,"x":443.1037275440666,"y":1363.2247009712887,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":443.1037275440666,"fy":1363.2247009712887},{"id":646,"name":"Aegeus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"King of Athens and father of the hero Theseus.

The tribute was to be seven maidens and seven youths sent every year from Athens to Crete to feed Asterion, the minotaur. Theseus joined the tribute and killed Asterion to lift the tribute and free Athenians from their terrible burden. Aegeus had told Theseus to use white sails on their return journey to indicate success. Theseus forgot and when Aegeus saw the black sails he threw himself to his death in the sea below in despair.
