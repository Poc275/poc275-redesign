One day he encountered Silenus, Dionysus's sidekick, in a drunken revelry. He showed him much hospitality which was rewarded by Dionysus with any wish he wanted. Having a rush of blood to the head perhaps, and because his kingdom was struggling for money, he wished for anything that he touched be turned to gold. His wish was granted but he quickly realised this was indeed, a curse. Even his wife and daughter were transformed, he couldn't touch anything. Pleading with Dionysus, who told him he was lucky that Silenus was so fond of him, made it so that anything he washed in the nearby river would be transformed back again. A relieved Midas quickly restored his wife and daughter back to human form. He then devoted his life to a more bucolic existence becoming a follower of Pan, the god of nature. One day when Pan and Apollo were playing music, Midas had the temerity to say that Pan's playing was better than Apollo's. Luckily he caught Apollo in a good mood and his only punishment was to have his ear's transformed into those of an ass, becuase only the ears of an ass could not appreciate such music. From then on he wore a turban to keep his ears a secret, only his barber knew the truth. His barber, unable to keep it a secret any longer, buried the words, \"Midas has the ears of an ass\" in the ground. This would grow into a flower which released the words into the wild.
