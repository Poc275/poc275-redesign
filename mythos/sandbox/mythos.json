Queen of the underworld, Persephone, convinced her husband to let Orpheus play one song and if it moves them they shall release Eurydice. He played the most amazing song that transformed the underworld into a place of light and love. Hades agreed to let Eurydice go but on one condition, that she must follow ten paces behind and if he turns around to look at her, she will be kept in the underworld. He kept the correct pace right until the edge of the underworld, but unbeknownst to him, his last few steps had accelerated into a run, Eurydice, too far behind was still not over the threshold of the underworld when Orpheus looked back in triumph and she was pulled back into the darkness. Orpheus lived out the rest of his life shunning any advances from women eventually sparking the ire of the Ciconians, followers of Dionysus who found his music an affront to their dark dances. They tore him apart in a Bacchic frenzy. His head ended up on the island of Lesbos where it was taken to a cave where people would come from all around to seek guidance and to hear his music once more.

He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Ae\u00ebtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him.

During his travels he cleared the route of all evil, slaying monsters and murderes alike to enter Athens held aloft by an adoring public grateful to have the road made safe once more. Aegeus' wife, Jason's widow, Medea, was adamant that her own son, Medus, and not Theseus would be the heir to throne of Athens so she persuaded Aegeus, who didn't know it was his long lost son at this point, to order him to kill the Marathonian Bull. Theseus accomplished this heroic feat, inventing ancient bull fighting in the process. Medea then contrived to have him poisoned. Aegeus agreed, believing Theseus' fame was a threat to his rule. Just as Theseus was about to drink the poison, Aegeus noticed his sword. It was the exact same sword that he'd buried back in Troezen for his son to find one day. He managed to stop him drinking the poison just in time and father and son were united. Medea fled Athens never to return. Theseus then went to Crete to lift the tributes that Athens had to pay. This was due to Aegeus sending Minos' (King of Crete) son Androgeus to kill the Marathonian Bull and getting killed. Minos threatened to raze Athens to the ground unless a tribute of seven maidens and seven youths were sent from Athens every year to feed the minotaur Asterion. Theseus sent himself as one of the sacrifical lambs where he fell in love with Minos' daughter, Ariadne. She gave him a ball of cotton which he used to find his way through the labyrinth to kill Asterion. He fled Crete with Ariadne to the island of Naxos. It was here that Theseus had a dream in which Dionysus warned him to leave Ariadne on the island as she was betrothed to him. He took the tough decision to leave her to save the Athenians he'd managed to save from being sacrificed to Asterion. He later took Antiope, an Amazon warrior as his queen kickstarting the Attic War, or Amazonomachy. They managed to defeat the Amazons but Antiope was killed in the process. He then had a sort of mid-life crisis, getting into all sorts of scrapes with his best friend Pirithous. They had the terrible idea one day of trying to kidnap Persephone, Queen of the underworld to be Pirithous' wife. Hades had them cast into stone chairs, their buttocks stuck to the seats. Heracles managed to free them during his twelfth labour to retrieve Cerberus. He married Phaedra, the younger sister of Ariadne. When visiting his son Hippolytus, Phaedra, Hippolytus' step-mother, was struck by a curse sent from Aphrodite in revenge for Hippolytus' neglect in all matters of love. Phaedra declared her love to Hippolytus but it wasn't reciprocated. Phaedra cried rape to Theseus who prayed to his father Poseidon for justice. Hippolytus was trampled to death in a chariot \"accident\". Upon hearing this Phaedra killed herself. Theseus was exiled from Athens for this unwitting role in the deaths of his son and wife. The end of his life was marked by shame and bitterness. He ended up as the guest of King Lycomedes of Skyros where one day he fell to his death over a cliff, pushed by Lycomedes but the reason is lost to us.
