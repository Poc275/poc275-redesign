He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status.

Later she goaded him by transforming into a fly to escape, he transformed into a lizard and ate her (in a shocking Kronos eating his children repeat). Metis then worked inside his head crafting armour and weapons giving Zeus an almighty headache. Hephaestus and Prometheus conjured a plan to fix the pain. They forged an axe that split Zeus' head in two from which Athena emerged. (Zeus' head then healed itself). Athens is named after her after she gifted the city the world's first olive tree.

This was foiled when his wife discovered the plan, took revenge by drowning their two children, and fled back to her father. He angered the gods so much that Zeus personally sent Thanatos to take him to the underworld. However, proud of his cunning, he tricked Thanatos into handcuffing himself by mocking his shackles and saying that they wouldn't work. He then kept Thanatos prisoner in his wardrobe. Knowing that without death, the gods would be on his tail sooner or later, he made a pact with his new wife to not make offerings to the gods when he did eventually die so that he couldn't cross the River Styx. When Thanatos was finally rescued he came for him again and took him to the underworld. When he couldn't cross the Styx he swam across, looking the worse for wear on the other side he spoke with Persephone, Queen of the underworld, and told her that his appearance was due to his wife's neglect in not making offerings to the gods to enable his passage. A shocked Persephone wanted to punish his wife, but Sisyphus tricked her into sending him back to life to take revenge on her in person. They would go on to live happily ever after. When his wife died and Persephone's decree finally expired, Thanatos came for him a third time, but this time Hermes offered him a deal, in cheating death twice you have earned a chance at immortality. All you have to do is push this boulder up the slope and out of the opening at the top to attain immortality, or, you can go to Elysium and live a happy afterlife. Sisyphus thought that the task was possible so that's what he chose. He is still there to this day, in the halls of Tartarus, pushing the boulder up the hill only to fail and see it come crashing down again.","home":"Corinth","age":"Bronze","nearest_olympian":7,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":153,"x":797.2146094011216,"y":1078.30191264006,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":797.2146094011216,"fy":1078.30191264006},"target":{"id":164,"name":"Aeolus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"King of Aeolia, later called Thessaly.","home":"Island of Aeolia","age":"Bronze","nearest_olympian":7,"distance_to_olympian":3,"index":154,"x":690.518931856101,"y":1184.7335670818125,"vy":-0.021740690554065016,"vx":-0.020836924943307158},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"parent","index":320},{"source":{"id":164,"name":"Aeolus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"King of Aeolia, later called Thessaly.","home":"Island of Aeolia","age":"Bronze","nearest_olympian":7,"distance_to_olympian":3,"index":154,"x":690.518931856101,"y":1184.7335670818125,"vy":-0.021740690554065016,"vx":-0.020836924943307158},"target":{"id":106,"name":"Hellen","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Heroes","notes":"Son of the survivors of the flood Deucalion and Pyrrha who kick started the Silver Age.

His love for her was so complete that he couldn't bear to trick her so he left. Psyche was non the wiser and went back to sleep. She would eventually end up with Eros but agreed to his demand that she could never see him in person. Tricked by her sisters into looking at Eros she lost everything. She would exact revenge, see Zona and Calanthe.","home":"Olympus","age":"Bronze","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":175,"x":448.2782379118352,"y":1002.6636100157143,"vy":-0.02562183447336373,"vx":-0.018744655076090588},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"parent","index":356},{"source":{"id":189,"name":"Melia","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Female","group":"Oceanids","notes":"nan","home":"Thebes","age":"Bronze","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":3,"index":179,"x":635.2069682906005,"y":955.3376254780393,"vy":-0.025826256915013297,"vx":-0.018995035210339618},"target":{"id":11,"name":"Oceanus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"God of Fresh Water","gender":"Male","group":"Titans","notes":"God of the earth-encircling River Oceanus, the source of all of the earth's fresh water.","home":"River Oceanus","age":"Golden","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":10,"x":652.5021643848376,"y":572.2457407581261,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":652.5021643848376,"fy":572.2457407581261},"distance_to_olympian":3,"type":"parent","index":357},{"source":{"id":189,"name":"Melia","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Female","group":"Oceanids","notes":"nan","home":"Thebes","age":"Bronze","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":3,"index":179,"x":635.2069682906005,"y":955.3376254780393,"vy":-0.025826256915013297,"vx":-0.018995035210339618},"target":{"id":188,"name":"Inachus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"God of The River Inachus","gender":"Male","group":"River Gods","notes":"One of the very earliest rulers in Greece.

Metis then worked inside his head crafting armour and weapons giving Zeus an almighty headache. Hephaestus and Prometheus conjured a plan to fix the pain. They forged an axe that split Zeus' head in two from which Athena emerged. (Zeus' head then healed itself). Athens is named after her after she gifted the city the world's first olive tree. Her signature appearance is with an owl on her shoulder, symbol of watchful wisdom, and the serpent coiled around her feet, symbol of guile, as shown by her father winning over her mother. Like Demeter, she would remain untouched by man.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":510},{"source":{"id":265,"name":"Dia","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Female","group":"Humans","notes":"Wife of Ixion, the King of Lapiths and daughter of Deioneus, King of Phocis.

This was foiled when his wife discovered the plan, took revenge by drowning their two children, and fled back to her father. He angered the gods so much that Zeus personally sent Thanatos to take him to the underworld. However, proud of his cunning, he tricked Thanatos into handcuffing himself by mocking his shackles and saying that they wouldn't work. He then kept Thanatos prisoner in his wardrobe. Knowing that without death, the gods would be on his tail sooner or later, he made a pact with his new wife to not make offerings to the gods when he did eventually die so that he couldn't cross the River Styx. When Thanatos was finally rescued he came for him again and took him to the underworld. When he couldn't cross the Styx he swam across, looking the worse for wear on the other side he spoke with Persephone, Queen of the underworld, and told her that his appearance was due to his wife's neglect in not making offerings to the gods to enable his passage. A shocked Persephone wanted to punish his wife, but Sisyphus tricked her into sending him back to life to take revenge on her in person. They would go on to live happily ever after. When his wife died and Persephone's decree finally expired, Thanatos came for him a third time, but this time Hermes offered him a deal, in cheating death twice you have earned a chance at immortality.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"target":{"id":430,"name":"Alcmene","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Female","group":"Humans","notes":"Impregnated by Zeus as he wanted to guard against Hera's prophecy that someone from the line of Perseus would save the Olympians.

Alcemene got help from Galanthis and Historis who tricked Eileithyia into thinking the baby had been born.

He was rescued and taken to Corinth where he was raised by the King and Queen, Polybus and Merope. They named him Oedipus which means 'swollen foot' after the scars on his once shackled ankles. During his life he heard rumours that he was adopted so he consulted with the Delphic oracle. Instead of being told who his real parents were, in typical oracular cryptic fashion he was told, \"Oedipus will kill his father and mate with his mother\". He decided to leave Corinth to avoid the possibility of the prophecy coming true. Whilst on the road he got into a fight with a man in a chariot who had hurled abuse at him to get out of the way, Oedipus killed him and his entourage during the ensuing fight. He ended up making his way toward Thebes, he answered one of the Sphinx's riddles on the way to reopen the road and lift the curse. He was welcomed into the city as a hero and welcomed by Queen Jocasta, unbeknownst to Oedipus, this was his real mother. She told him that her husband had been killed on the road by a gang of robbers, this was the very same fight that Oedipus had gotten into, part of the prophecy had come true. In time he fell in love with Jocasta. He became King and they married and had four children, thus completing the prophecy. Later in his reign he again sought the advice of the Delphic oracle about a vicious plague that had swept through the kingdom. The Pythia answered, \"Thebes will be relieved when the murderer of King Laius is named and found.\" Oedipus sent for Laius' servant, Antimedes, who was the sole survivor of the fight that fateful day. As soon as Antimedes set eyes on Oedipus the whole horrendous truth came out. Oedipus discovered his true parents, his being abandoned by his mother and now wife, Jocasta, and the fact that the horrible prophecies had all come true.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":582},{"source":{"id":303,"name":"Danaë","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Female","group":"Heroes","notes":"Impregnated by Zeus who transformed into a shower of golden rain to reach her.

He was rescued and taken to Corinth where he was raised by the King and Queen, Polybus and Merope. They named him Oedipus which means 'swollen foot' after the scars on his once shackled ankles. During his life he heard rumours that he was adopted so he consulted with the Delphic oracle. Instead of being told who his real parents were, in typical oracular cryptic fashion he was told, \"Oedipus will kill his father and mate with his mother\". He decided to leave Corinth to avoid the possibility of the prophecy coming true. Whilst on the road he got into a fight with a man in a chariot who had hurled abuse at him to get out of the way, Oedipus killed him and his entourage during the ensuing fight. He ended up making his way toward Thebes, he answered one of the Sphinx's riddles on the way to reopen the road and lift the curse. He was welcomed into the city as a hero and welcomed by Queen Jocasta, unbeknownst to Oedipus, this was his real mother. She told him that her husband had been killed on the road by a gang of robbers, this was the very same fight that Oedipus had gotten into, part of the prophecy had come true. In time he fell in love with Jocasta. He became King and they married and had four children, thus completing the prophecy. Later in his reign he again sought the advice of the Delphic oracle about a vicious plague that had swept through the kingdom. The Pythia answered, \"Thebes will be relieved when the murderer of King Laius is named and found.\" Oedipus sent for Laius' servant, Antimedes, who was the sole survivor of the fight that fateful day. As soon as Antimedes set eyes on Oedipus the whole horrendous truth came out. Oedipus discovered his true parents, his being abandoned by his mother and now wife, Jocasta, and the fact that the horrible prophecies had all come true. Jocasta ran away and hanged herself in the bedroom. Oedipus found her and thrust her gold brooch dress pins into his eyes in anguish.","home":"Thebes","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":6,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":289,"x":894.2116553771983,"y":1714.2277305441482,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":894.2116553771983,"fy":1714.2277305441482},"distance_to_olympian":3,"type":"acquaintance","index":633},{"source":{"id":336,"name":"Creon","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"King of Thebes, ruling after King Laius was murdered by Oedipus, unbeknownst to him at the time, Laius was Oedipus' father.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":640},{"source":{"id":341,"name":"Tithonus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"Lover of Eos, goddess of dawn.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":703},{"source":{"id":380,"name":"Daphnis","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Heroes","notes":"Lover of both Hermes and Pan, Pan taught him to play the pipes.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":727},{"source":{"id":393,"name":"Polybotes","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Gigantes","notes":"One of the giants who fought the Olympians during the Gigantomachy.

He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status.

It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":763},{"source":{"id":399,"name":"Typhoeus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Gigantes","notes":"One of the giants who fought the Olympians during the Gigantomachy.

He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":779},{"source":{"id":402,"name":"Phoitios","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Gigantes","notes":"One of the giants who fought the Olympians during the Gigantomachy.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":799},{"source":{"id":406,"name":"Astraios","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"God of Stars & Planets","gender":"Male","group":"Titans","notes":"nan","home":"Sky","age":"Golden","nearest_olympian":2,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":395,"x":597.1060799550172,"y":527.3774163558995,"vy":-0.030614124643421278,"vx":-0.021621020851980626},"target":{"id":13,"name":"Crius","roman_name":"Megamedes","god_of":"God of Constellations","gender":"Male","group":"Titans","notes":"nan","home":"Tartarus","age":"Golden","nearest_olympian":11,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":12,"x":884.3955902292383,"y":430.4457557741335,"vy":-0.027298569753988238,"vx":-0.019972910689061256},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"parent","index":800},{"source":{"id":406,"name":"Astraios","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"God of Stars & Planets","gender":"Male","group":"Titans","notes":"nan","home":"Sky","age":"Golden","nearest_olympian":2,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":395,"x":597.1060799550172,"y":527.3774163558995,"vy":-0.030614124643421278,"vx":-0.021621020851980626},"target":{"id":39,"name":"Eurybia","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"God of Mastery of the seas","gender":"Female","group":"Titans","notes":"nan","home":"Sea","age":"Golden","nearest_olympian":11,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":38,"x":861.3961326717769,"y":423.596732459401,"vy":-0.027034698084778805,"vx":-0.020110136892791026},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"parent","index":801},{"source":{"id":406,"name":"Astraios","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"God of Stars & Planets","gender":"Male","group":"Titans","notes":"nan","home":"Sky","age":"Golden","nearest_olympian":2,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":395,"x":597.1060799550172,"y":527.3774163558995,"vy":-0.030614124643421278,"vx":-0.021621020851980626},"target":{"id":38,"name":"Eos","roman_name":"Aurora","god_of":"God of The Dawn","gender":"Female","group":"Titans","notes":"Goddess of dawn, she opened the gates to let the sun chariot out each morning.

He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":885},{"source":{"id":453,"name":"Phyleus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"Son of Augeas, he stuck up for Heracles when Augeas reneged on the deal to clean out the Augean stables for three-hundred of his cattle.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":903},{"source":{"id":462,"name":"Pelias","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"He had nine daughters, the most beautiful, Alcestis, was promised only to the man who was able to harness a boar and a lion to a chariot.

He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":906},{"source":{"id":464,"name":"Podargos","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Female","group":"Animals","notes":"One of Diomede's mares, the 'flashing-footed'.

He wanted to enter Athens a hero to finally meet his father, so he set out along the dangerous coastal route from Troezen. During his travels he cleared the route of all evil, slaying monsters and murderes alike to enter Athens held aloft by an adoring public grateful to have the road made safe once more. Aegeus' wife, Jason's widow, Medea, was adamant that her own son, Medus, and not Theseus would be the heir to throne of Athens so she persuaded Aegeus, who didn't know it was his long lost son at this point, to order him to kill the Marathonian Bull. Theseus accomplished this heroic feat, inventing ancient bull fighting in the process. Medea then contrived to have him poisoned. Aegeus agreed, believing Theseus' fame was a threat to his rule. Just as Theseus was about to drink the poison, Aegeus noticed his sword. It was the exact same sword that he'd buried back in Troezen for his son to find one day. He managed to stop him drinking the poison just in time and father and son were united. Medea fled Athens never to return. Theseus then went to Crete to lift the tributes that Athens had to pay. This was due to Aegeus sending Minos' (King of Crete) son Androgeus to kill the Marathonian Bull and getting killed. Minos threatened to raze Athens to the ground unless a tribute of seven maidens and seven youths were sent from Athens every year to feed the minotaur Asterion. Theseus sent himself as one of the sacrifical lambs where he fell in love with Minos' daughter, Ariadne. She gave him a ball of cotton which he used to find his way through the labyrinth to kill Asterion. He fled Crete with Ariadne to the island of Naxos. It was here that Theseus had a dream in which Dionysus warned him to leave Ariadne on the island as she was betrothed to him. He took the tough decision to leave her to save the Athenians he'd managed to save from being sacrificed to Asterion. He later took Antiope, an Amazon warrior as his queen kickstarting the Attic War, or Amazonomachy. They managed to defeat the Amazons but Antiope was killed in the process. He then had a sort of mid-life crisis, getting into all sorts of scrapes with his best friend Pirithous. They had the terrible idea one day of trying to kidnap Persephone, Queen of the underworld to be Pirithous' wife. Hades had them cast into stone chairs, their buttocks stuck to the seats. Heracles managed to free them during his twelfth labour to retrieve Cerberus. He married Phaedra, the younger sister of Ariadne. When visiting his son Hippolytus, Phaedra, Hippolytus' step-mother, was struck by a curse sent from Aphrodite in revenge for Hippolytus' neglect in all matters of love. Phaedra declared her love to Hippolytus but it wasn't reciprocated. Phaedra cried rape to Theseus who prayed to his father Poseidon for justice. Hippolytus was trampled to death in a chariot \"accident\". Upon hearing this Phaedra killed herself. Theseus was exiled from Athens for this unwitting role in the deaths of his son and wife. The end of his life was marked by shame and bitterness. He ended up as the guest of King Lycomedes of Skyros where one day he fell to his death over a cliff, pushed by Lycomedes but the reason is lost to us. His legacy wasn't tarnished however, Theseus goes down as one of the great heroes of Greek myth, and the greatest in all of Athens. His statue stands proudly in the centre of Athens today in Syntagma Square.","home":"Athens","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":0,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":634,"x":476.92666143122824,"y":1418.9354115527537,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":476.92666143122824,"fy":1418.9354115527537},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":941},{"source":{"id":478,"name":"Busiris","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Kings & Villains","notes":"Son of Aegyptus in Egypt, the Greeks had a distaste for the human sacrifices performed by the priests of Osiris, from whom Busiris got his name.

He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":948},{"source":{"id":480,"name":"Meleager","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"One of Jason's Argonauts.

He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":952},{"source":{"id":480,"name":"Meleager","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"One of Jason's Argonauts.

He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":971},{"source":{"id":489,"name":"Peleus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Heroes","notes":"Friend of Heracles, he helped him take revenge on Laomedon, King of Troy for refusing payment for one of his labours.

He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":974},{"source":{"id":489,"name":"Peleus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Heroes","notes":"Friend of Heracles, he helped him take revenge on Laomedon, King of Troy for refusing payment for one of his labours.

He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":988},{"source":{"id":495,"name":"Cteatus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Molionides","notes":"Conjoined twin brother of Eurytus.

He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":994},{"source":{"id":498,"name":"Nestor","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"Took over his father's (Neleus) throne after Heracles took revenge on him for not atoneing him of the killing of Iphitus.

He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":1023},{"source":{"id":512,"name":"Hebe","roman_name":"Juventas","god_of":"God of Youth & Brides","gender":"Female","group":"Olympians","notes":"Hera's cupbearer she bestowed her hand to Heracles upon his death to be his eternal wife.","home":"Olympus","age":"Silver","nearest_olympian":6,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":501,"x":704.7238457794855,"y":799.4338655614866,"vy":-0.02789630819478765,"vx":-0.02024243564898156},"target":{"id":71,"name":"Hera","roman_name":"Juno","god_of":"Queen of the Gods, god of Marriage, Women, the Sky & Stars of Heaven","gender":"Female","group":"Olympians","notes":"Swallowed by Kronos when born due to Ouranos' curse on him that \"Your own children will overthrow you as you overthrew me\".

It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"spouse","index":1026},{"source":{"id":513,"name":"Atreus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"The Heraclides, children of Heracles, installed Atreus on the deposed Eurystheus' throne.","home":"Mycenae","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":10,"distance_to_olympian":3,"index":502,"x":1068.3381065282165,"y":1421.393990404057,"vy":-0.024571346067952974,"vx":-0.017452113945228886},"target":{"id":276,"name":"Pelops","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Heroes","notes":"King of Pisa in the Peloponnese.

One day she was pursued by Aristaeus and she fell into a ditch trying to escape and was bitten by an adder and died. The grief caused Orpheus to stop playing his beautiful music, even the Gods wept. Finally his father Apollo told him to retrieve Eurydice from the underworld with a lyre strung with hairs from his own head. His mellifluous playing won over the hound of hell, Cerberus, and Charon, the ferryman of the dead, which enabled him to enter the palace of Hades itself. Queen of the underworld, Persephone, convinced her husband to let Orpheus play one song and if it moves them they shall release Eurydice. He played the most amazing song that transformed the underworld into a place of light and love. Hades agreed to let Eurydice go but on one condition, that she must follow ten paces behind and if he turns around to look at her, she will be kept in the underworld. He kept the correct pace right until the edge of the underworld, but unbeknownst to him, his last few steps had accelerated into a run, Eurydice, too far behind was still not over the threshold of the underworld when Orpheus looked back in triumph and she was pulled back into the darkness. Orpheus lived out the rest of his life shunning any advances from women eventually sparking the ire of the Ciconians, followers of Dionysus who found his music an affront to their dark dances. They tore him apart in a Bacchic frenzy. His head ended up on the island of Lesbos where it was taken to a cave where people would come from all around to seek guidance and to hear his music once more. Apollo, jealous that the shrine was becoming more popular than his own Delphic oracle, finally silenced him. Finally at peace, his spirit descended to the underworld where he could be with Eurydice at last.","home":"Thrace","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":8,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":73,"x":837.1487353909235,"y":1284.969042463696,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":837.1487353909235,"fy":1284.969042463696},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"spouse","index":1051},{"source":{"id":528,"name":"Eurydice","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Female","group":"Humans","notes":"Wife of Orpheus.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":1058},{"source":{"id":530,"name":"Jason","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Heroes","notes":"Smuggled out of Iolcos when he was a baby due to Pelias and Neleus laying siege to the city believeing they were the rightful heirs to the throne and not his father, Aeson.

It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"target":{"id":514,"name":"Bellerophon","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Heroes","notes":"Tamed the winged horse Pegasus, from which point on they would never be separated. Accidentally killed his brother, Deliades, during a hunting trip. He sought penance with King Proetus of Mycenae whose wife, Stheneboea, forced herself on Bellerophon but he refused her charms and insulted her in the process. He was sent to Iobates with a sealed letter detailing the false allegations. Iobates decided to get rid of Bellerophon by getting him to kill Chimera. He managed to defeat Chimera with an arrow of lead which melted inside Chimera's body after she breathed fire. He was sent on more and more dangerous missions until he realised that Iobates had meant him harm all along. He was confronted by the citizens of Iobates' kingdom and without Pegasus, he was unable to defend himself. He prayed to his father Poseidon who flooded the local river Xanthus to show them that he was protected by the gods. When Iobates saw this he realised the letter must be false. He cleared up the whole mess and even married his daughter, Philonoë. When Stheneboea heard about the marriage she realised her deceit had been uncovered and she hung herself. Bellerophon grew into quite an arrogant and vain man. One day he flew with Pegasus to Olympus believing that he'd be welcomed due to his divine parentage. Zeus punished his hubris by striking Pegasus with a gadfly. Bellerophon landed on the rocks below and crushed his hip, Pegasus was kept on Olympus by Zeus to carry his thunderbolts. Bellerophon lived out his final days as a crippled, bitter and lonely man.","home":"Corinth","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":0,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":503,"x":266.50484825086943,"y":1416.0630636376607,"vy":-0.02630255631554804,"vx":-0.01910104971232505},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":1060},{"source":{"id":531,"name":"Bisaltes","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"Founder hero of the Bisaltae peoples of Thrace.","home":"Thrace","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":0,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":520,"x":476.314202911636,"y":770.2548954570519,"vy":-0.03033303879655954,"vx":-0.01891048261478808},"target":{"id":6,"name":"Gaia","roman_name":"Terra","god_of":"God of The Earth","gender":"Female","group":"The First Order","notes":"Mother Earth.

To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result.

To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result.

When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"distance_to_olympian":3,"type":"acquaintance","index":1122},{"source":{"id":564,"name":"Thrax","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"A son of Ares, the god of war.

He was brought up by his mother's (Alcimede) friend, the great centaur, Chiron. Met Bellerophon, who was seeking help from Chiron for Pegasus burned skin at the hands of Chimera. He filled his head with heroic feats which influenced Jason in his formative years. When his tutelage with Chiron was finished he ventured back to Iolcos. On the journey he lost a sandal helping an old lady (Hera in disguise) across a river. It was prophecised to Pelias to beware of a man arriving from the country with one sandal so when he arrived in Iolcos, Pelias knew immediately who he was. Pelias agreed to let him take the throne but lied to him, telling him the land was cursed and that the only way to lift the curse was to retrieve the Golden Fleece. He arranged a mighty ship, the Argo, and a great crew, the Argonauts, to sail to Colchis and retrieve the fleece. When the Argonauts arrived at Colchis, King Aeëtes demanded three tests of Jason before he could take it. To tame the fire breathing bulls, the Khalkotauroi, to sow some dragon's teeth from Cadmus and defeat the army that sprouts from the ground, and to kill the dragon that guards the fleece. He managed these feats thanks to his new lover, Medea, whom Hera had had Eros strike her with his cupid's arrow. They escaped with the fleece back to Pelias where they realised he was never going to give up the throne so Medea tricked his nine daughters into killing him, believing they were being taught a magic trick and would be brought back to life. They had to flee Iolcos after this blood killing and sought refuge in Corinth. Here Jason fell for the King's daughter, Creusa. Medea, so enraged at this betrayal after everything she had done for him killed Creusa and her father, King Creon. In a terrible denouement she even killed her children. A broken Jason lived on Corinth until his old friend Peleus persuaded him to return to Iolcos and overthrow Acastus, the King. They managed this and he was finally on the throne of Iolcos. This didn't last long however as one day, asleep under the Argo, a rotten beam fell on him and killed him. It was an ironic twist as he was warned years before during the voyage to repair the damage caused during the crossing of the Bosporus, but who knew this would be the deadly outcome.","home":"Iolcos","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":3,"distance_to_olympian":2,"index":519,"x":555.4465983159582,"y":1490.1123896559316,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":555.4465983159582,"fy":1490.1123896559316},"distance_to_olympian":3,"type":"acquaintance","index":1152},{"source":{"id":575,"name":"Cytoros","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Phrixides","notes":"Son of Phrixus and Chalciope.

He was rescued from their grasp by Aphrodite who whisked him away to Marsala in his home kingdom of Sicily, a place now famous for its honey-sweet wine.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":1181},{"source":{"id":585,"name":"Alcinous","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"King of Scheria, modern day Corfu.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"acquaintance","index":1301},{"source":{"id":645,"name":"Theseus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Heroes","notes":"Theseus discovered his father was Aegeus, King of Athens.

During his travels he cleared the route of all evil, slaying monsters and murderes alike to enter Athens held aloft by an adoring public grateful to have the road made safe once more. Aegeus' wife, Jason's widow, Medea, was adamant that her own son, Medus, and not Theseus would be the heir to throne of Athens so she persuaded Aegeus, who didn't know it was his long lost son at this point, to order him to kill the Marathonian Bull.

This was due to Aegeus sending Minos' (King of Crete) son Androgeus to kill the Marathonian Bull and getting killed. Minos threatened to raze Athens to the ground unless a tribute of seven maidens and seven youths were sent from Athens every year to feed the minotaur Asterion. Theseus sent himself as one of the sacrifical lambs where he fell in love with Minos' daughter, Ariadne. She gave him a ball of cotton which he used to find his way through the labyrinth to kill Asterion. He fled Crete with Ariadne to the island of Naxos. It was here that Theseus had a dream in which Dionysus warned him to leave Ariadne on the island as she was betrothed to him. He took the tough decision to leave her to save the Athenians he'd managed to save from being sacrificed to Asterion. He later took Antiope, an Amazon warrior as his queen kickstarting the Attic War, or Amazonomachy. They managed to defeat the Amazons but Antiope was killed in the process. He then had a sort of mid-life crisis, getting into all sorts of scrapes with his best friend Pirithous. They had the terrible idea one day of trying to kidnap Persephone, Queen of the underworld to be Pirithous' wife. Hades had them cast into stone chairs, their buttocks stuck to the seats. Heracles managed to free them during his twelfth labour to retrieve Cerberus. He married Phaedra, the younger sister of Ariadne. When visiting his son Hippolytus, Phaedra, Hippolytus' step-mother, was struck by a curse sent from Aphrodite in revenge for Hippolytus' neglect in all matters of love. Phaedra declared her love to Hippolytus but it wasn't reciprocated. Phaedra cried rape to Theseus who prayed to his father Poseidon for justice. Hippolytus was trampled to death in a chariot \"accident\". Upon hearing this Phaedra killed herself. Theseus was exiled from Athens for this unwitting role in the deaths of his son and wife. The end of his life was marked by shame and bitterness. He ended up as the guest of King Lycomedes of Skyros where one day he fell to his death over a cliff, pushed by Lycomedes but the reason is lost to us. His legacy wasn't tarnished however, Theseus goes down as one of the great heroes of Greek myth, and the greatest in all of Athens. His statue stands proudly in the centre of Athens today in Syntagma Square.","home":"Athens","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":0,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":634,"x":476.92666143122824,"y":1418.9354115527537,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":476.92666143122824,"fy":1418.9354115527537},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":1321},{"source":{"id":656,"name":"Leus","roman_name":"nan","god_of":"nan","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"Theseus' spy in the Palliantidae camp.

Hippolytus was trampled to death in a chariot \"accident\". Upon hearing this Phaedra killed herself. Theseus was exiled from Athens for this unwitting role in the deaths of his son and wife. The end of his life was marked by shame and bitterness. He ended up as the guest of King Lycomedes of Skyros where one day he fell to his death over a cliff, pushed by Lycomedes but the reason is lost to us. His legacy wasn't tarnished however, Theseus goes down as one of the great heroes of Greek myth, and the greatest in all of Athens. His statue stands proudly in the centre of Athens today in Syntagma Square.","home":"Athens","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":0,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":634,"x":476.92666143122824,"y":1418.9354115527537,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":476.92666143122824,"fy":1418.9354115527537},"distance_to_olympian":1,"type":"parent","index":1349},{"source":{"id":668,"name":"Hippolytus","roman_name":"Virbius","god_of":"God of Forests","gender":"Male","group":"Humans","notes":"Son of Theseus and the Amazon warrior Antiope.

He wanted to enter Athens a hero to finally meet his father, so he set out along the dangerous coastal route from Troezen. During his travels he cleared the route of all evil, slaying monsters and murderes alike to enter Athens held aloft by an adoring public grateful to have the road made safe once more. Aegeus' wife, Jason's widow, Medea, was adamant that her own son, Medus, and not Theseus would be the heir to throne of Athens so she persuaded Aegeus, who didn't know it was his long lost son at this point, to order him to kill the Marathonian Bull. Theseus accomplished this heroic feat, inventing ancient bull fighting in the process. Medea then contrived to have him poisoned. Aegeus agreed, believing Theseus' fame was a threat to his rule. Just as Theseus was about to drink the poison, Aegeus noticed his sword. It was the exact same sword that he'd buried back in Troezen for his son to find one day. He managed to stop him drinking the poison just in time and father and son were united. Medea fled Athens never to return. Theseus then went to Crete to lift the tributes that Athens had to pay. This was due to Aegeus sending Minos' (King of Crete) son Androgeus to kill the Marathonian Bull and getting killed. Minos threatened to raze Athens to the ground unless a tribute of seven maidens and seven youths were sent from Athens every year to feed the minotaur Asterion. Theseus sent himself as one of the sacrifical lambs where he fell in love with Minos' daughter, Ariadne. She gave him a ball of cotton which he used to find his way through the labyrinth to kill Asterion. He fled Crete with Ariadne to the island of Naxos. It was here that Theseus had a dream in which Dionysus warned him to leave Ariadne on the island as she was betrothed to him. He took the tough decision to leave her to save the Athenians he'd managed to save from being sacrificed to Asterion. He later took Antiope, an Amazon warrior as his queen kickstarting the Attic War, or Amazonomachy. They managed to defeat the Amazons but Antiope was killed in the process.

Prometheus lived with the humans but became concerned as to their lack of zest, he decided they needed fire, but not just normal fire, divine fire, which would enflame their sense of imagination and daring. He stole divine fire from Hephaestus's forge on Mount Olympus and taught mankind how to make use of it. Zeus would take his revenge by binding him on the Caucasus Mountains to be pecked at by vultures every day for eternity. As he was immortal he would heal overnight only to be tortured again the next day. He proclaimed that his love for mankind and seeing them flourish thanks to him would be balm for any pain.

Zeus had wanted a child in the blood line of Perseus as Hera had prophecised that a child of Perseus would save the Olympians. Hera was so incensed at yet another affair of Zeus that she swore eternal enmity against Alcides. Alcmene sought advice from the oracle Tiresias who told her that \"Alcides will do marvellous things, slay terrible monsters and topple tyrants, but Hera will hound him without mercy. To placate her, you could try changing his name perhaps... how about Hera's pride?\" From then on Alcides would be known as Heracles. Blessed with immense strength, courage and power, he was also cursed with a short fuse. One fateful day he was confronted by a demon and two dragons which he duly killed, but when he looked at the corpses it was in fact his wife Megara and their two children. It was the work of Hera, in one of her cruelest interventions. She had stripped Heracles of everthing, his family and reputation. Not knowing how to atone he sought guidance at Delphi. He was instructed, via Hera, to report to Eurystheus, King of Mycenae, who owed his throne to Hera as she had induced his birth before Heracles and thus denied him the throne. He was ordered to serve the King for ten years, and he must do whatever the King asks of him. He completed twelve labours, ordered by Eurystheus and was finally freed and granted immortality for completing his penance. He thus regained his heroic status. He would go on to fight in the Gigantomachy and save the Olympians from the Gigantes. For this Hera's hatred turned into grateful loveand she lifted the curse upon him. In later life he encountered Nessus, a centaur whose family and friends Heracles had killed in one of his tantrums. Nessus tried to molest his wife Deianira and Heracles shot him down with his Hydra poisoned arrows. Nessus tricked Deianira to give the shirt he was wearing to Heracles if ever their marriage was in trouble. Later on she did gift him the shirt, thinking it was charmed. The poison took hold and killed Heracles in the most agonising way, Deianira killed herself as a result. Achieving immortality for his labours, Zeus raised him to the firmament as the constellation Hercules.","home":"Olympus","age":"Heroic","nearest_olympian":5,"distance_to_olympian":1,"index":280,"x":700.3838625473716,"y":1132.077320263871,"vy":0,"vx":0,"fx":700.3838625473716,"fy":1132.077320263871},"distance_to_olympian":2,"type":"acquaintance","index":1367},{"source":{"id":675,"name":"Seirenes","roman_name":"Sirens","god_of":"nan","gender":"Female","group":"Sirens","notes":"Three monstrous sea-nymphs with bodies of birds and heads of women.
