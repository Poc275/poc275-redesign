                <h3>The design and implementation of my own programming language &mdash; Frooble</h3>
                <p>Frooble is an imperative language with functional programming features. It is a high level, verbose, general programming 
                    language that aims to be easy to learn. Syntactically and semantically it is very similar to Java and C#.</p>

                <p>Frooble Hello World:</p>
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    <code>
print "Hello, World!"
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>All basic data types are supported: integers, floats, strings, bools and arrays. Object orientation is supported with 
                    class based inheritance:</p>

                <p>Static scoping is supported allowing local and global variables. Control flow is provided by while loops and for loops. Decisions 
                    are supported through if/else statements. Code reuse is allowed via functions, which also return values. Frooble programs are 
                    read ahead so functions can be called before they are defined, C like prototypes are therefore not required. Functions can also 
                    be stored as variables and executed later as per first-order functions, which is common in the functional programming paradigm:</p>

                <p>I wanted Frooble to be able to communicate easily with the outside world, any useful programming language does not exist in isolation. 
                    Frooble can communicate with C/C++ through the <abbr title="Java Native Interface">JNI</abbr>, allowing easy access to an already 
                    available standard library. Frooble can export symbols for use in other languages, for example the Python interpreter can be embedded, 
                    or a C program can read exported Frooble symbols. This is achieved via memory mapped files, so any language with support for reading file 
                    mappings can integrate with Frooble. A web data type is also available for consuming web APIs. This data type takes a URL that returns 
                    JSON data. This data is then bound to a Frooble class which can be easily accessed to retrieve the data. The aim of this data type was to 
                    abstract out a lot of the hard work involved in consuming web APIs:</p>

                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    <code>
string city = "Derby"

web weather = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + city + ",uk&units=metric"

print "The weather in " + city + " is " + weather.description + " with a temperature of " + weather.temp + " degrees celsius"
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>The actual implementation is an interpreter written in Java using the ANTLR4 parser generator. ANTLR removes a lot of the hard work 
                    involved in parsing source code, leaving a nice syntax tree to work with. For appreciation a small part of the language was implemented 
                    as a compiler targeting the virtual architecture LLVM.</p>

                        ANTLR grammar tree for a Frooble method declaration. Once the source code is parsed into a tree it can be walked to interpret the 
                        instructions. The instructions can be implemented in any other language, usually a lower level language such as machine code, but in 
                        this case Java is used for simplicity.

                <p>This project, although a challenge, was very rewarding. It completed a lot of gaps in my knowledge in terms of how programming 
                    languages have evolved and why there are so many of them. In the early years of learning to program you are never really told 
                    why languages are constructed how they are. It is not until you try and create your own that you can get an appreciation for 
                    the myriad factors that are involved. The overall lesson from this work was that there isnâ€™t really any sort of magic happening, 
                    there are just lower levels of detail.</p>
