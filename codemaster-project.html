                <p>This project was my first attempt at making an Android app. It is a remake of the old board game Mastermind where the object of the 
                    game is to crack a coloured code within an allotted number of attempts. Feedback pegs indicate how close you are to a correct guess 
                    after each turn.</p>

                <p>The project provided a different type of challenge because of the hardware limitations inherent in mobile devices. Due to the multi-tasking 
                    nature of a mobile device, many applications will be running at any one time, meaning memory is at a premium. This warranted a judicious 
                    use of new objects to minimise time spent garbage collecting, member variables were accessed directly instead of via getters and setters 
                    to speed things up, and static classes were favoured over non-static to save on memory.</p>

                <p>One of the most important optimisations was the use of threads. The main thread drives the user interface loop, so if this is affected 
                    by slow performance the user receives a not responding warning. This acute lack of responsiveness is particularly evident on touch screen 
                    devices where users expect a much faster response to interactions than with a traditional mouse. Therefore any work that is potentially 
                    time consuming is fired off onto a child thread, keeping the user interface responsive.</p>
