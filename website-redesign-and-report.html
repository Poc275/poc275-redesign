            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>This project was focused on client-side web development, involving HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It involved re-designing a local 
                    packaging companyâ€™s website and <a href="downloads/extra-packaging-website-report.pdf" target="_blank">writing a report, detailing 
                    how the re-design improved upon the original</a>.</p>

                <p>The report focused on the following aspects:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>How well the site adheres to current web standards</li>
                    <li>Cross-browser compatibility</li>
                    <li>Accessibility & usability</li>
                    <li>Search engine optimisation</li>
                    <li>Site content in relation to the target audience</li>
                </ul>

                <p>One of the major problems with the site was a lack of separation between content and style. The entire structure was created using 
                    a HTML table, which it isnâ€™t designed for. The CSS was practically non-existent as all of the styling was done inside the HTML. This 
                    led to a horrible tangle of HTML code that would be extremely difficult to maintain.</p>

                <p>This also had a knock on accessibility. By improving the structure of the site and separating content, style and interactivity 
                    correctly between HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the accessibility of the site improved as screen readers were able to scan the pages 
                    and users could modify certain aspects such as font size without the layout breaking.</p>

                        <i class="fas fa-camera"></i> Original home page before the redesign. The lack of content hierarchy is perhaps the most striking aspect. The 
                        font sizes are all the same which results in a confusing and unpleasant experience. The background image also detracts the user from 
                        reading the content.

                <p>This project really opened my eyes to the importance of a well written website. By writing clear, validated mark-up and separating the 
                    styling, many benefits can be achieved, such as cross-browser compatibility, better search ranking, easier maintenance and improved 
                    accessibility. This was a thoroughly enjoyable project, I particularly enjoyed the feeling of &lsquo;crafting&rsquo; a web page through 
                    well written HTML and CSS as up until this point I had only used <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors such 
                    as Dreamweaver with little appreciation of the code that it created.</p>
