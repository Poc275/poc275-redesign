                <p>I was down the pub with a group of friends, Brexit was a painful, not so distant memory and The Donald had just 
                    lost the popular vote to become the 45th President of the United States. Over a drink and multiple &ldquo;How has this happened?&rdquo; 
                    platitudes bordering on the absurd we decided to don our geek capes (hats? costumes?) and do something about it. This 
                    is how revolutions start right? Hardly Lenin in Vienna, but in our own indomitable fashion we set about making our dent in 
                    the world.</p>

                <p>We decided that reminding people that, although it may be a bad time now, there are people out there that can 
                    still provide us with hope in this post truth world. With Donald Trump victory rallies piercing the background it was 
                    inevitable üòä that we‚Äôd converge on the old card game &ldquo;Top Trumps&rdquo; as the format for our nascent showcase of extraordinary 
                    human beings. For those souls fortunate enough not to remember the dark days of games that aren‚Äôt played on computers, Top 
                    Trumps is a card game where a deck of cards is based on a certain theme (usually cars) and each card is scored on certain 
                    categories (top speed, horsepower, size etc.) with the aim being to compare these values to try and &ldquo;trump&rdquo; the opponent‚Äôs 
                    score and win the card. A web-based revamp of this alleged classic game was in order, Top Heroes was born! üçæ</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Back in the post-pub, relentless real world the solution was surprisingly still coherent. The MEAN stack would mean a single 
                    language (JavaScript) throughout the application, both server and client side, and we could therefore be sure that each part of 
                    the stack would talk to each other easily. Node.js would gives us high throughput and scalability via its non-blocking event-driven 
                    paradigm. This is done through the use of callbacks, notifying us when a task is complete meaning it can process other requests 
                    instead of blocking until completion. All of this without having to make the Faustian pact with threads. Using Express on top of 
                    Node.js provides a nice web framework that makes it easy to build an API. The data model is relatively straight-forward with 
                    collections in MongoDB for cards and users. I found the NoSQL approach meant we could get up and running quickly with a database, 
                    but it was easier for redundancy to creep in which a traditional SQL approach would have caught through normalisation. The schema-less 
                    nature helped during the early development stages, but eventually most data is structured, ours being no different, so Mongoose was 
                    used as an ORM providing data validation.</p>

                <p>On the client-side Angular.js gave us the ability to make a dynamic web application. By making AJAX requests under the hood to update 
                    the game whilst in progress the users are under the impression that it is a &ldquo;live game&rdquo; and they‚Äôre not presented with a page refresh 
                    every time data needs updating. The MVC approach in Angular.js is familiar to most web developers which helped get up to speed quickly. 
                    The only barrier being the full indoctrination into how things are named, and features such as directives are tricky to get right 
                    (that dreaded context), but the idea behind it was sound (meaningful HTML tags controlling their own behaviour) which ultimately made it worthwhile 
                    as you end up with a nice separation of concerns and semantic markup. The UI was created using the excellent 
                    <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/latest/" target="_blank">Angular.js material library</a> which provided UI controls inspired by the 
                    Google Material Design language. Socket.io was used to provide real-time communication between the players during a game.</p>

                <p>We decided to make use of Azure as our hosting platform. This way we could scale when the disaffected masses came calling to play. Azure 
                    Web Apps was used to host the application. This PaaS offering meant that we didn‚Äôt have to worry about setting up and maintaining and 
                    infrastructure. Azure Blob Storage was used to host the static content. The database was hosted elsewhere, the MongoDB 
                    offering in Azure, Cosmos DB, being too expensive for our needs, so we settled for mLab‚Äôs free tier. Continuous integration was set up 
                    using TravisCI which built the app and ran the tests. This then deployed to Azure to complete the continuous deployment pipeline. This 
                    eventually morphed into a Docker image on a Linux container in Azure which we found to be much faster and just as easy to deploy.</p>

                <h3>Six months later...</h3>
                <p>I have a confession to make. My retelling of the story may not have been strictly 100% bona-fide accurate due to the drunken haze it 
                    was conceived in. In a shocking fake news twist the project I described wasn‚Äôt the one that materialised. It was part of the discussion 
                    but what can I say, we just couldn‚Äôt contain our disillusionment and anger with the political situation, despair trumped hope so 
                    <a href="https://toptrumps.azurewebsites.net/#!/" target="_blank">this is the end result</a>. Now, before you click I take no responsibility 
                    for any offence caused. It is not so much tongue-in-cheek as tongue-puncturing-cheek, it is meant as a joke, a parody if you will and 
                    absolutely not mean to cause offence. You have been warned!</p>

                <h3>// TODO</h3>
                <p>Top Heroes is still in development and will be released soon if you prefer, how shall I put it? A more optimistic gaming experience.</p>
                
                <p>I felt the in-game play could be clunky at times due to it being a web app and the layout not being optimal at certain breakpoints. I‚Äôve 
                    been playing with the cross-platform framework <a href="https://flutter.io/" target="_blank">Flutter</a> lately and I‚Äôm tempted to port 
                    it to an Android/iOS app. This can consume the API of the application already built so it‚Äôs just another front-end in essence. Stay tuned&hellip;</p>

                <p>The fact that only a single user can play a card at any one time provided a tricky UX problem. How could the user not in play be sure what 
                    was happening? If the user in play took too long the other player was likely to quit. In game chat was implemented to facilitate the players 
                    talking to each other to try and alleviate this, and also provides some of the essence of the old game where players can talk about their 
                    cards. A future improvement could be a timer to limit the time spent playing a card.</p>
